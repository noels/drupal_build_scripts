Review your environment properties settings.  The example below uses dev.properties.

Create a properties file containing site specific settings called site.properties


and run: 

gradle deployDrupal -Denv=dev -Dsite=site -Dsrc=$WORKSPACE/src -Dworkspace=$WORKSPACE -DBUILD_NUMBER=$BUILD_NUMBER

The above line is suitable for pasting into a jenkins job's "switches" input box.
